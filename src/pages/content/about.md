Is there are need for GoodGlobe? In the below graphic we outline a few of our motivations. One benefit we see in this platform is *fast* planning and action. Another need we hope to address is more discussion between people observing in the field and people observing through data, which is somewhere in the *knowledge* and *community* bubbles. While this is just a sketch, we'd like to hear why you think GoodGlobe is - or isn't - needed in conservation.
